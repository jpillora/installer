# `installer`

Quickly install Go (golang) binaries from Github releases.

Installer is an HTTP server which returns shell scripts to install Go programs. The returned script will detect platform OS and architecture, choose from a selection of URLs, download the appropriate file, un(zip|tar|gzip) the file, find the binary and optionally move it into your `PATH`. Useful for installing your favourite Go programs on hosts without the Go compiler installed.

## Usage

```sh
curl https://i.jpillora.com/<user>/<repo>@<release>! | bash
```

*Or you can use* `wget -qO- <url> | bash`

**Path API**

* `user` Github user (defaults to @jpillora, customisable if you [host your own](#host-your-own))
* `repo` Github repository belonging to `user` (**required**)
* `release` Github release name (defaults to the **latest** release)
* `!` When provided, downloads binary directly into `/usr/local/bin/` (defaults to working directory)

**Query API**

* `?type=` Force the return type to be one of: `script` or `homebrew`
    * `type` is normally detected via `User-Agent` header
    * `type=homebrew` is **not** working at the moment – see [Homebrew](#homebrew)
* `?insecure=1` Force `curl`/`wget` to skip certificate checks

## Security

:warning: Although I promise [my instance of `installer`](https://i.jpillora.com/) is simply a copy of this repo - you're right to be wary of piping shell scripts from unknown servers, so you can host your own server [here](#host-your-own) or just leave off `| bash` and checkout the script yourself.

    *You can optionally add your own domain as a app custom domain.*

### Homebrew

Currently, installing via Homebrew does not work. Homebrew was intended to be supported with:

```
#does not work
brew install https://i.jpillora.com/serve
```

However, homebrew formulas require an SHA1 hash of each binary and currently, the only way to get is to actually download the file. It **might** be acceptable to download all assets if the resulting `.rb` file was cached for a long time.
