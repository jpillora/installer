# `installer`

Quickly install pre-compiled binaries from Github releases.

Installer is an HTTP server which returns shell scripts. The returned script will detect platform OS and architecture, choose from a selection of URLs, download the appropriate file, un(zip|tar|gzip) the file, find the binary (largest file) and optionally move it into your `PATH`. Useful for installing your favourite pre-compiled programs on hosts using only `curl`.

## Usage

```sh
# install <user>/<repo> from github
curl https://i.jpillora.com/<user>/<repo>@<release>! | bash
```

```sh
# search Google for github repo <query>
curl https://i.jpillora.com/<query>! | bash
```

*Or you can use* `wget -qO- <url> | bash`

**Path API**

* `user` Github user (defaults to @jpillora, customisable if you [host your own](#host-your-own), uses Google to pick most relevant `user` when `repo` not found)
* `repo` Github repository belonging to `user` (**required**)
* `release` Github release name (defaults to the **latest** release)
* `!` When provided, downloads binary directly into `/usr/local/bin/` (defaults to working directory)
* `!!` Uses `sudo` to `mv` into `/usr/local/bin/`

**Query Params**

* `?type=` Force the return type to be one of: `script` or `homebrew`
    * `type` is normally detected via `User-Agent` header
    * `type=homebrew` is **not** working at the moment – see [Homebrew](#homebrew)
* `?insecure=1` Force `curl`/`wget` to skip certificate checks

## Security

:warning: Although I promise [my instance of `installer`](https://i.jpillora.com/) is simply a copy of this repo - you're right to be wary of piping shell scripts from unknown servers, so you can host your own server [here](#host-your-own) or just leave off `| bash` and checkout the script yourself.

### Modifying the Installation Script for Host Your Own

To modify the installation script for a host-your-own installation, you will need to do the following:

1. Change line 11 of `handler/init.go` to reflect your github username (`_ "github.com/[YOUR-GITHUB-NAME-HERE]/installer/scripts"`)
1. Similarly, import your handler in `main.go` on line 8 (`"github.com/[YOUR-GITHUB-NAME-HERE]/installer/handler"`)
1. Change `go.mod` to your module name as well (`module github.com/[YOUR-GITHUB-NAME-HERE]/installer`)
1. Deploy to heroku

### Homebrew

Currently, installing via Homebrew does not work. Homebrew was intended to be supported with:

```
#does not work
brew install https://i.jpillora.com/serve
```

However, homebrew formulas require an SHA1 hash of each binary and currently, the only way to get is to actually download the file. It **might** be acceptable to download all assets if the resulting `.rb` file was cached for a long time.
